An uber basic game data controller.

Built for keeping a handful of variables between levels, set this script to AutoLoad in Project Setting. All variables we want to keep between levels can be stored in a dicitonary, access them from anywhere with User_Data.store.[YourVariable]. We will be able to up or restore the entire dictionary in one go.
